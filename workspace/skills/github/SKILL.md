**GitHub Workflow (Ops Focus)**

Use this skill when asked to summarize what changed or what is deployed.

Prefer concise changelog style:
- `commit hash`
- `purpose`
- `impact`

**Output style**
- 3-6 bullet points max.
- Mention deployment UUID if available.
- Never use # headers or pipe tables in output.
